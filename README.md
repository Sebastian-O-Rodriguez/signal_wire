# Signal Wire Code Challenge - Sebastian Rodriguez 

## Assignment Instructions

Please utilize SignalWire's resources to demonstrate your coding knowledge! An IVR (interactive voice response) is a telephony business staple that you are probably very familiar with. "Thanks for calling XYZ..press 1 to talk to support, press 2 to talk to sales, or press 3 to record a voicemail." Use any of the SignalWire SDKs to build a basic IVR application that does all of the following:

handle inbound calls to a SignalWire number
play a short menu to the caller offering them at least two menu options that will accept input and perform an action based on the caller input (i.e. record voicemail, forward a call, gather customer information, etc.)
Feel free to use ANY of our resources to help you accomplish this!

## Task

I created a SWML script in my Signal Wire test space to create an IVR where you press 1 to connect to sales and 2 to leave a voicemail. Call +1 (203) 547-4470 to use my IVR.
Documents used:

sales_bin.png - numbers used
ivr_swml_script.yaml - contains the script used for +1 (203) 547-4470, called test_number.
test_number.png - shows setup for the working number.
sales_number.png - shows setup for the sales number to be connected to.
sales_bin.png  - shows the XML contents of the bin used in sales_number.png
